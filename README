Bank account transactions into GnuCash
======================================

This is what I use in order to get my bank account transaction
histories into GnuCash. The procedure is common to all bank accounts:

1. Download raw account history file from the bank's online interface.
   Do this for each bank account (set the transaction query period as
   appropriate; I download them each month).

2. Run make, which will generate QIF files from all newly added raw files.

3. Import the generated QIF files into GnuCash.

The exact format of the raw account history file depends on the bank.
The Makefile and the converter scripts run from therein support
account history downloads from the following banks.
